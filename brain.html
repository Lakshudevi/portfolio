      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project leverages a deep learning approach to detect brain tumors using 3D MRI images. 
        The innovative two-pathway-group CNN architecture enhances detection accuracy by capturing both local and global features. 
        The system also integrates a cascaded multicast design, significantly improving computational efficiency while reducing instability.

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> 3D MRI images of the brain were used as the primary dataset for tumor detection.</li>
        <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> The images were normalized and segmented to focus on regions of interest (ROIs).</li>
        <li><strong>Model Design:</strong> A novel two-pathway-group CNN architecture was developed:
          <ul>
            <li>Pathway 1 captures local features for fine-grained detection.</li>
            <li>Pathway 2 extracts global features for overall structural insights.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Outputs from both pathways were integrated using a cascaded multicast design, enhancing overall model stability and precision.</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> The model was evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
      </ol>
